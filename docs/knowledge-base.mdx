## File Uploads

You can upload reference documents to improve your botâ€™s accuracy.

- **Supported Formats:** PDF, DOCX, TXT
- **Max File Size:** 10 MB per file
- **Usage:** The bot will use these files to enrich responses when the knowledge base is toggled ON

## Toggle OFF Behavior

When the knowledge base is OFF, the chatbot ignores all uploaded files and relies solely on instructions and functions.

## Add FAQs

You can also add question-answer pairs manually. This is useful for static help content like pricing, policies, or operating hours.

- **Add FAQ** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> Opens a form to input your question and answer
- **All FAQs are searchable by the bot** when the knowledge base is enabled
