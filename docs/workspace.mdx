Here’s what you get by default:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Free Credits" icon="square-check">
    Every user receives **50 credits**, equal to **500,000 AI tokens** (1 credit = 10,000 tokens). These are used to test your bots and run conversations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Select Model Wisely" icon="thumbtack">
    To use these free credits, you must select **DacoidChat** as the model while creating your chatbot. If you use your own API key (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini), token usage still counts, but you’re billed externally.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Accounting" icon="rotate">
    Tokens are deducted for both **input and output**—whether you’re testing or chatting live.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Platform Fees" icon="credit-card">
    There are currently no platform charges during the beta.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bot Limit" icon="robot">
    Users can create up to **5 bots**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
