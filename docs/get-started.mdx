## What is DacoidChat?

**DacoidChat is a no-code platform where developers and consultants can build highly customized AI chatbots powered by agentic workflows.** Instead of manually dragging blocks in a flow builder, you simply write an AI prompt describing what the bot should do—DacoidChat handles the logic behind the scenes. It’s built for fast, flexible automation across lead generation, customer support, and more.

## Why Use DacoidChat?

- **Fast setup, no friction:** Go from idea to working chatbot in minutes by describing your bot’s task—no need for clunky flow builders.
- **No-code, prompt-first approach:** Just write an instruction. DacoidChat handles the logic generation, variable parsing, and API triggers automatically.
- **Third-party friendly:** Easily connect your bots to any external app or backend using webhooks, APIs, and custom variables.
