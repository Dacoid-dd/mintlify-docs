## Functions

Functions let your chatbot fetch data or take actions during a conversation.

**Primary Use Cases:**

1. **Fetching Data** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> Pull info from external APIs (e.g., user profile, weather, product info).
2. **Taking Action** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> Trigger workflows like form submission, appointment booking, or CRM updates.

Each function includes:

- **Name** – A unique identifier for the function (e.g., send_email, check_credit)
- **Description** – Helps the bot understand when and why to use this function
- **Server URL** – The webhook endpoint (e.g., Make.com or n8n)
- **Delay Message** – Optional message shown while waiting for a response
- **Variables** – Parameters required to execute the function

You can add multiple functions to the same bot.

## Variables

Variables define the **inputs** your function needs to operate. These are dynamically extracted from the user’s conversation.

Each variable includes:

- **Name** – What the data represents (e.g., email, amountOwed, dateRequested)
- **Description** – Helps the AI understand what kind of data it’s looking for

**Example Variables:**

- **email** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> User’s email address
- **code** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> A verification code
- **amountOwed** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> The outstanding balance to be paid

These variables are passed along with your function call to ensure accurate and personalized data transfer.
